# Grade estimation
The code reads a CSV file containing the grades of students and performs various data exploration tasks on the data using the pandas and matplotlib libraries in Python. It then calculates various descriptive statistics like range, variance, and standard deviation, and plots graphs to show the data distributions, density, and standard deviations.The code performs linear regression on a sample dataset containing two variables - 'Grade' and 'StudyHours'. It calculates the slope, intercept, and regression line equation for the relationship between the two variables. It then uses the equation to make a prediction of the expected grade for a given study time (14 hours per week) and prints out the estimated grade. The end result is a scatter plot of the sample data with the regression line, and a printed estimate of the grade for a given study time based on the regression equation.

The data exploration tasks performed on the data are as follows:

   *  The CSV file containing the grades data is downloaded from a URL and saved to a local file.

   *  The data is loaded into a pandas dataframe.

   *  The dataframe is checked for missing data and any rows containing missing data are removed.

   *  A new column is added to the dataframe indicating whether a student passed or failed (assuming a passing grade is 60).

   *  A function is created to show the distribution of a given variable in the dataframe. The function plots a histogram and a box plot, and adds lines for the mean, median, and mode.

   *  The function is called multiple times with different variables from the dataframe, to explore the distributions of different variables.

   *  Another function is created to show the density of a given variable in the dataframe. The function plots a density plot and adds lines for the mean, median, and mode.

   *  The function is called once with a variable from the dataframe to explore its density.

   *  The range, variance, and standard deviation of the Grade and StudyHours columns in the dataframe are calculated and printed.

   *  A Gaussian kernel density estimate is created for the Grade column, and the density plot is annotated with lines for 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean.
